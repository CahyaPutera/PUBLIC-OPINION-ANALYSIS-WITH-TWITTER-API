# PUBLIC-OPINION-ANALYSIS-WITH-TWITTER-API

This mini project was made as a Sanbercode class' graduation requirement. 

The idea of this project was basically to analyze the public opinion by scrapping Twitter data. 
Started by mining the data using Twitter API, then to find and analyze the pattern between the data, process the data, and create a text classifier to further analyze the sentiment on it using Natural Language Processing model algorithms.
